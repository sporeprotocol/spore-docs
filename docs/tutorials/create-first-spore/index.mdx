# Create Your First Spore

Imagine having complete ownership and control over your digital content, stored securely on a decentralized blockchain, without relying on external URLs or third-party platforms. That's the power of Spore Protocol!

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to create your very first spore from scratch.

Before we begin, let's take a quick look at this example:

<EmbedCard

  href="https://a-simple-demo.spore.pro/spore/0x075b32100cbc6c082b4c80cd2e2713c30ae0eb2f494dddff435d206061ba7493"
  className="margin-top--sm margin-bottom--lg"
/>

This spore, hosted on the Nervos CKB Testnet, stores an image directly on the blockchain. With Spore Protocol, you have *full* control over the *entire* content, not just a URL to where the content is stored often off-chain.

If this piques your interest, let's dive into this step-by-step guide to:

1. [Set up an account on Nervos CKB](./setup-account)
