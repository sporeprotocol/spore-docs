# Creating Simple On-Chain Blog

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the Spore Protocol to build an on-chain blog. By the end, you'll have your own basic on-chain blog, similar to the one demonstrated here: [https://spore-blog-tutorial.vercel.app](https://spore-blog-tutorial.vercel.app/)

You can find the code repository for this tutorial at: [https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-blog-tutorial](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-blog-tutorial). In this repository, you can explore different branches to see the code at various stages of development. We will clearly indicate which branch corresponds to each stage as we progress.

## Tools You Need

- **npm**: package manager
- **Next.js**: to quickly set up our project
- **React**: for handling view logic
- **Spore SDK**: software development kit used to interact with the Spore Protocol in TypeScript
- **Lumos**: for building DApps on Nervos CKB
- **Wallet**: for interacting with the DApp, we are using Metamask for this tutorial

## Getting started

First, we need a framework to build upon. In this tutorial, we'll use Next.js as the foundation for our project. You can clone the basic project code by running the following command:

```bash
git clone -b 00-base https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-blog-tutorial.git
```

In the **project directory**, run `npm install` and `npm run dev`

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and see "Hello World" displayed on the browser.

### Upcoming Stages:

1. Set up wallet as log-in for the application
2. Build up the blog site
3. Publish your blog posts on-chain!
