# Introducing Spore Protocol

The on-chain digital asset protocol designed to empower ownership, distribution, and value capture.

**Developers** seeking to build innovative solutions can leverage Spore Protocol to support users, creators and collectors with digital asset.

### What Sets Spore Protocol Apart?

Spore Protocol redefines the game by addressing common limitations in existing NFT solutions:

- **True On-Chain Ownership:** Unlike many NFT solutions that rely on Web2 hosting, where NFT holders may not own much more than a URL or an ID, Spore Protocol ensures holders have complete on-chain ownership, providing true security and control.
- **Expansive Creative Flexibility:** Tired of simple JPEGs? Spore Protocol opens up new possibilities for expressing yourself on-chain, allowing for a wide range of content types, unlocking more use cases.
- **Frictionless Interaction:** Say goodbye to the need to hold gas fees in your wallet before you can interact with your NFT. With Spore, you can seamlessly interact with your digital assets without any transaction friction, better user experience, better adoption.
- **Backed by Tokenomics:** Spore Protocol ensures that digital assets are created with intrinsic value. Each Spore is backed by tokens one can redeem at any time. The value increases as the utilization of on-chain space grows.
