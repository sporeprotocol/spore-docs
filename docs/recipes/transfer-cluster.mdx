# Transfer Cluster

In this recipe, you will learn how to transfer ownership of a [cluster](/basics/spore-101#what-is-a-cluster) using the [spore-sdk](https://docs.spore.pro/resources/spore-sdk). Owning a cluster doesn’t grant ownership of the spores associated with that cluster.

## Transfer a Cluster

You can execute a transfer using the `transferCluster` API from spore-sdk:

```tsx
import { transferCluster } from '@spore-sdk/core';

let { txSkeleton } = await transferCluster({
  outPoint: {
    txHash: '0xb1f94d7d8e8441bfdf1fc76639d12f4c3c391b8c8a18ed558e299674095290c3',
    index: '0x0',
  },
  toLock: RECEIVER_LOCK_SCRIPT,
});
```

- `outPoint` - Specifies the target cluster for the transfer, identified by its transaction hash and index.
- `toLock` - The lock script of the new owner/recipient of the cluster.

## Extras

### Code example

For a valid on-chain transaction, you'll need to sign the transaction and send it to the chain.

Here's a code example for how to transfer a cluster with [`CKB default lock`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all.c):
