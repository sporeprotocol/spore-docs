description: Getting started with the basics concepts of Spore Protocol.

# Technical Design
> Spore protocol is engineered to embed value into on-chain contents and non-fungible tokens.

Spore is built on the [Cell model](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/concepts/cell-model/), an extension of of Bitcoin UTXO, providing enhanced asset ownership and proof-based verification capabilities

There are two defined cell types: `Spore Cell` and `Spore Cluster Cell`, of which Spore cell is the fundamental and the only necessary unit in the protocol. Other cell types are optional and may serve as extension cells, providing extra information to a Spore.

As illustrated above, Spore cells come in three forms:

- Multiple Spores cells (Spore #1, #2) assigned to a cluster (Spore Cluster #1)
- A single Spore cell (Spore #4) assigned to a cluster (Spore Cluster #2)
- A standalone Spore cell, i.e., a Spore without a cluster (Spore #3)

Spore Protocol is anchored around the following key functionalities:

- Immutable digital asset issuance
- Permanent on-chain storage
- Minimized cell specification dedicated for content storage
- Built-in extensibility on the protocol level


## Data structure

Spore Protocol uses [Molecule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0008-serialization/0008-serialization.md#molecule) as its serialization format standard. Basic types used in this standard are described as bellow:

```css
vector Bytes <byte>;
array Bool [byte; 1];
option BoolOpt (Bool);
option BytesOpt (Bytes);
```

### Spore Cell

Every **Spore** must follow this data structure:

```css
table SporeData {
    content_type: Bytes,
    content: Bytes,
    cluster_id: BytesOpt,
}
```

### Cluster Cell

Every **Cluster** must follow this data structure.

```css
table ClusterData {
    name: Bytes,
    description: Bytes,
}
```
